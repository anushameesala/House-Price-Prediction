# House-Price-Prediction
Analyzing the data, cleaning, preprocessing , feature selection, adding new features and applying ML models. 
Here I delt with missing values and choose the features which I feel important and dropped some of them which I felt not necessary based on correlation values.
the target will be sales price and rest all are the features on which we will work on
I have also plotted some of the graphs where one can clearly understand the data visualization
Applied the Basic ML models and tried with improvized features too
you can try XGBOOST and LGBT to test the models which will give you high accuracy.
